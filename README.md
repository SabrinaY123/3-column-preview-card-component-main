## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned that I can achieve a more concise amount of code with CSS Grid! I was frustrated with CSS Flex because I was trying to do two-dimensional layouts only to realize I should be relying on CSS Grid! Its a big sigh of relief to realize what I was doing wrong before!

### Continued development

I want keep playing around with CSS Grid so that I can make sure I fully understand it! There is alot more to it than I had originally assumed.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Resource](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This was a very useful resource for CSS Grid elements.
